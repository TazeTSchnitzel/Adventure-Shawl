Adventure Shawl
===============

A text adventure written in PHP 5.6. Install the dependencies with `composer install`.

The name is meant to resemble *Adventure Call*, a recurring segment of the Scottish sketch comedy series *Limmy's Show!*, which inspired me to make this. The current game actually begins with [Greg's adventure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qyYg_bfrlw).

**SPOILER ALERT!**: `gameData/gameData.php` creates the `Game` and `Room` objects that describe the game's content. If you don't want to be spoiled, you probably shouldn't touch that file.
